A D3 and Leaflet visualization of movies shot in San Francisco by genre, year and location. Visualizations include a point density by year and genre, and a seriation graph.

Data covers 1911-2015; it was obtained from https://data.sfgov.org/ and supplemented by primarily IMBD data. A couple of other websites were consulted as well.

Limitations: It is problematic to accurately visualize such data because a) it is incomplete; b) there are many definitions of movie genres; and c) geographically, it is easy to represent point density, but representing line density (e.g., chase scenes that cover multiple roads) opens too much room for data interpretation.

Genre definitions were primarily obtained from AFI[www.afi.com] and movies with unknown genres were excluded. Movie shooting locations that could not be represented easily as a point (e.g., chase scenes), were excluded as well. In many cases, a shooting location is a landmark, e.g., the Golden Gate Bridge. In this case, a geographic centroid was used.

The data used here are as good as it gets at the moment of the project completion.
